I used Lighthouse to check the pages and made sure the colors and fonts are clear and the site is accessible. I also tested the page in different browsers—Chrome, Safari, and Firefox—and confirmed it works properly in all of them. I checked that all internal links are working and properly redirecting between pages. I also tested that external links to social media sites open in a new tab. Lastly, I made sure the contact form works, with all fields required, the email field accepting only valid emails, and the submit button working as expected.
